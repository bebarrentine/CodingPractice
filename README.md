# Coding Practice
A repository of programming exercises. Yay!

## Exercise One: Leap Year

In this exercise, you will need to use user inputs, a single for loop, and if/elif statements to make a program that can display which years a leap years within a given range. For example, if the user inputs the starting year 2000 and the ending year 2016 then it would print "2000 2004 2008 2012 2016".

Example Output:

Keep in mind, it's best to be able to prevent errors before they happen; therefore, have it set to where the program will only accept an integer for the user inputs. 

**As a bonus:** If the user enters a letter, have the program prompt the user again until they enter an integer. This can be done in several different ways so get creative

## Exercise Two: Drawing Diamonds

This exercise uses user input, for loops, if statements, and print statements to create the five stages of code to develop a complete diamond using asterisks and spaces. Keep in mind the user input must be an odd number.

Example Output:

<img src="https://github.com/bebarrentine/CodingPractice/blob/master/ProgrammingSC/DrawingDiamonds.JPG" width="300" height="400" />


**As a bonus:** Create an error statement to be printed if the user inputs an even number or invalid character. Have it set to prompt the user again for an answer or have the option to exit the code
