# Coding Practice
A repository of programming exercises. Yay!

## Exercise One: Leap Year

In this exercise, you will need to use user inputs, a single for loop, and if/elif statements to make a program that can display which years a leap years within a given range. For example, if the user inputs the starting year 2000 and the ending year 2016 then it would print "2000 2004 2008 2012 2016".

How the ouput should look:

Keep in mind, it's best to be able to prevent errors before they happen; therefore, have it set to where the program will only accept an integer for the user inputs. 
As a bonus: If the user enters a letter, have the program prompt the user again until they enter an integer. This can be done in several different ways so get creative

### Solution Code

Here is just one way to accomplish this exercise
