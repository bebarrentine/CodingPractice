# Program Description: The following code will draw a diamond-shaped picture by taking the user's input.
# This input determines the number of lines to be drawn.

# prompts the user for a number to represent the variable diamondHeight
print("---------Stage 1---------")
print('')

diamondHeight = #?

# prints the statement when the height is a validated number
print()

print('')

print("---------Stage 2---------")
print('')

a = 1 #a place holder variable used to calculate the height of the triangle
for a in range(?):
    top = #?
    print()

print('')

print("---------Stage 3---------")
print('')

a = 1 #a place holder variable used to calculate the combined length of the triangles two sides (1/4 of a diamond)
for a in range(?):
    if :
        top = #?
        print()

print('')

print("---------Stage 4---------")
print('')

a = 1 #a place holder variable used to calculate the top of the diamond
for a in range(?):
    if :
        top = #?
        print()

print('')

print("---------Stage 5---------")
print('')

a = 1  # a placeholder variable used to solve the top half of the diamond
b = 1  # a placeholder variable used to solve the bottom half of the diamond

# This for loop produces the top half of the diamond by alternating asterisks and spaces
for a in range(?):
    if :
        top = #?
        print()

# This for loop produces the bottom half of the diamond by alternating asterisks and spaces
for b in range(?):
    if :
        bot = #?
        print()
