# Program Description: This program will ask the user for the name of the file
# and then open that file.  It will also prompt the user for a full name and
# gender of the baby name. The program will then search the file for the first
# name in the appropriate column (one column for boys another for girls).  If
# the name is found, the rank for that name will be printed to the screen.

# no hints this time, you can ask if you need them ;)
